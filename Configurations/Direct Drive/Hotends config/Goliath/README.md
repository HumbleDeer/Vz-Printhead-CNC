- One could add Titanium sheet of 0.3mm sheet to brace at the nozzle to help stabilize the whole hotend. The 0.3mm sheet is easy to cut with kitchen cisor.
- Use the printed template [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-Printhead/blob/main/STLs/Goliath%20lower%20Titanium%20brace%20template.stl) to cut your brace

### NOTE: This Titanium brace mode is for advanced users.  Once you have the brace in hand, insert nozzle in the brace and install nozzle in heatblock, then bolt the 2x30mm bolts to the carriage. DO NOT install the brace on the head before installing the nozzle ! If you do that, chances are that you will screw on the nozzle at angle and will damage the threads on the block.  When you want to remove the nozzle, first loosen the nozzle a bit, then remove the 2xM3 30mm bolt. Then finishin unscrewing the nozzle. When you want to re-install the nozzle, repeat first step (install nozzle in brace, then screw on nozzle THEN do the bolts)
